# QNonogram
QNonogram is a Nonogram game built with Qt5, and allows the user to solve them. 

Nonograms, also known as Hanjie, Picross or Griddlers, are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or
left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. In this puzzle type, the numbers are a form
of discrete tomography that measures how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column.
